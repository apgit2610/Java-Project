### Prerequisites
- JDK 8 or higher
- NetBeans IDE
- MySQL Server
üîÑ Cloning and Running the Project
1. Clone the Repository:
   git clone https://github.com/apgit2610/Java-Project.git

2. Open in NetBeans:
   - Launch NetBeans.
   - Click on File > Open Project.
   - Navigate to and open the Java-Project folder.

3. Build and Run:
   - Right-click the project in the Projects pane.
   - Choose Build then Run.
üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup
1. Create the Database:

CREATE DATABASE virtual_classroom;
USE virtual_classroom;

CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    role ENUM('admin', 'teacher', 'student') NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE lectures (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    content TEXT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE videos (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    content LONGBLOB NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO users (username, password, role)
VALUES ('admin', '1234', 'admin');


2. Update Connection Settings:
Modify the database connection code in your Java files to match your local MySQL credentials:
java
String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/virtual_classroom";
String user = "your_mysql_username";
String password = "your_mysql_password";

üìå Notes
- Ensure your MySQL server is running before launching the application.
- For optimal performance, run the server component first before connecting clients.
- GUI may differ slightly based on your OS and screen resolution.
